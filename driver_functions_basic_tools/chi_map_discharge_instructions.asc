= Mapping Chi driven by discharge

This explains how to use software for mapping chi in which the chi coordinate is calculated by integrating discharge (rahter than drainage area) along channel lenght. 

== Compiling the program

You need a pass:[c++] compiler and the `make` utility to get the code working. 

If you have these, then go into the `driver_functions_ChiMap` folder in your terminal window and type:

[source,console]
----
$ make -f chi_map_discharge.make
----

There will be a number of warnings, you can ignore these. 

== Preparing your data

You will need a precipiation raster and a topography raster. 
First, make a data directory for these rasters.

You then need to project the rasters into a projected coordinate system (we typically use UTM WGS84), 
and convert them into the ENVI bil format. 

The best way to do this is with teh gdalwarp utility:

[source,console]
----
$ gdalwarp -t_srs '+proj=utm +zone=44 +south +datum=WGS84' -of ENVI My_DEM.tif My_DEM_UTM44.bil
----

You can modify the above line to reflect your filenames and your UTM zone and hemisphere. 

=== Naming and location of the DEM and precipitation data

The precipitation raster and elevation raster *MUST* have the same dimensions and projection. 
In addition, the two rasters should have the same prefix, but the precipitation raster should have the additional extension `_PRECIP`. 

The rasters must have the same cellsize as well. 

You can clip the rasters to the same shape with gdalwarp:

[source,console]
----
$ gdalwarp -te <x_min> <y_min> <x_max> <y_max> -of ENVI elevation.tif My_DEM.bil
$ gdalwarp -te <x_min> <y_min> <x_max> <y_max> -of ENVI precip.tif My_DEM_PRECIP.bil
----

Where `<x_min> <y_min> <x_max> <y_max>` will need to be replaced by identical UTM edges.

== Running the program

Navigate to the `driver_functions_ChiMap` folder and run it. It takes 5 ot 6 arguments. 

[cols="1,1,4", options="header"]
.Command line arguments for chi_map_discharge.exe
|===
|Argument number
|Description and link

|1
|Path to data (for example ~home/basins/Chile/)

|2
|Prefix of data. For example if the DEM is in the filed My_DEM.bil and My_DEM.hdr, then the prefix is My_DEM. 
Note that the precipitation file would then be My_DEM_PRECIP.bil

|3
|The input data format. For this example you should have `bil`. 

|4
|A threshold area for calculating chi. If this is zero, chi will be calculated everywhere. 
Otherwise, chi will be calculated for all pixels with greater drainage area. 

|5
|A flag for printing a csv file of the chi coordinate. 1 == true, 0 == false. Default is true. 
These files are *BIG* so leave as 0 unless you need to convert the chi information to a shapefile. 

|6
|OPTIONAL: This is a filename (the file needs to be in the data folder) of a list of node indices from which to calculate chi. 
It allows you to only calculate chi in given basins. The program automatically prints a node index raster so you can choose 
the basins using a combination of the discharge raster and the node index raster printed by the program. 

|===

An example program call would be: 

[source,console]
----
$ ./chi_map_discharge.exe ~home/basins/Chile/ Chile_test bil 50 1
----

or

[source,console]
----
$ ./chi_map_discharge.exe ~home/basins/Chile/ Chile_test bil 50 1 my_nodes.nodes
----

=== Program outputs

A `_NI` raster: contains the node indices. 

A `_Q` raster: contains discharge.

A `_chi_*` raster: The filename of this raster contains a number of parameers that were used to calculate chi: the m/n ratio, the Q_0 value and the threshold area. 

A `_HS` raster: contains the hillshade of the DEM.
