= Instructions for compiling MuddPILE

MuddPILE is a simple, raster-based landscape evolution model that is built for speed. The channel incision is based on the FASTSCAPE algorithm and nonlinear hillslope diffusion using an implicit method (the method is unpublished, one day I will write up nodes). 

The hillslope model in particualr requires something called http://www.simunova.com/home[MTL4]. MTL stands for matrix template library and can solve large sparce matrices very quickly. Sadly, this is a bit of a pain to install. 

== Installing MTL

So MTL, a bit like http://math.nist.gov/tnt/[TNT], is a header-only library. There is nothing to compile or link! Easy peasy, right?

Wrong. It needs something called http://www.boost.org/[Boost] to work. Boost is *HUGE*. 

First, you need to download and unzip the Boost library somewhere. Once you unzip it you should get a directory structure that looks something like

[source,console]
----
boost_1_64_0
|
|-boost
|-libs
|-tools
----

and loads of other stuff. 

When you unzip MTL you will also get a bunch of folders, if you navigate down you will get to a `numeric` folder. YOu need to copy everything in that folder into the 

[source,console]
----
boost_1_64_0
|
|-boost
  |
  |-numeric
----

folder.
