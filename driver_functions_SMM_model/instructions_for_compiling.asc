= Instructions for compiling MuddPILE

MuddPILE is a simple, raster-based landscape evolution model that is built for speed. The channel incision is based on the FASTSCAPE algorithm and nonlinear hillslope diffusion using an implicit method (the method is unpublished, one day I will write up nodes). 

The hillslope model in particualr requires something called http://www.simunova.com/home[MTL4]. MTL stands for matrix template library and can solve large sparse matrices very quickly. Sadly, this is a bit of a pain to install. 

== Steps to install MTL

So MTL, a bit like http://math.nist.gov/tnt/[TNT], is a header-only library. There is nothing to compile or link! Easy peasy, right?


Wrong. It needs something called http://www.boost.org/[Boost] to work. Boost is *HUGE*. 

=== Boost header library

. First, you need to download and unzip the Boost library somewhere. 
. You can dowload the tarball with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.64.0/source/boost_1_64_0.tar.gz
----
+
NOTE: This web address is correct as of August 2017 but you should http://www.boost.org/users/download/[check the boost downloads page] for the latest version.
+
. Put the `.gz` file somewhere sensible (I put it in `\usr\libs\`) and unzip it with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ tar -xvzf boost_1_64_0.tar.gz
----
+
. Once you unzip it you should get a directory structure that looks something like
+
[source,console]
----
boost_1_64_0
|
|-boost
|-libs
|-tools
----
+
and loads of other stuff. 
+
. Now you need to get http://www.simunova.com/home[MTL4].

=== MTL4 header library

. Get the latest version of MTL here: http://www.simunova.com/node/145
+
As of August 2017 you could directly download from:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget http://www.simunova.com/downloads/mtl4/MTL-4.0.9555-Linux.tar.gz
----
+
. Then unzip
+
[source,console]
----
$ tar -xvzf boost_1_64_0.tar.gz
----
+
. When you unzip MTL you will also get a bunch of folders, if you navigate down you will get to a `numeric` folder. You need to copy everything in that folder into the: 
+
[source,console]
----
boost_1_64_0
|
|-boost
  |
  |-numeric
----
+
folder.
